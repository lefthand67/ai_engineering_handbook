# About this repo

Hello and welcome to the repository with methodological articles on AI Software Engineering. Here I post the materials I create with my AI helpers with the goal to understand how to build and maintain production level AI apps. 

The repo is not about prompts, at least, not only about prompts, but about the entire infrastructure around the LLM that we have to build in order to get the reliable and long-term viable AI powered system.

The repo is in the draft state yet, but I am going to distill all the materials into a structured handbook. All the unpublished and dirty drafts are in the `docs/exp` branch, `in_progress` directory. Once the article is ready, it is moved to `main` branch to the dedicated directory.

## Authorship

This is a practical repo, not scientific, so I do not provide sources, you can find them using the helper - `./prompt_consultant.md` monolithic prompt. The lack of sources does not mean I claim that I am the author of ideas I state. I am the owner of files, not the author neither of articles, nor of ideas. I am just an engineer who stands on the shoulders of the giants, i.e. the collective consciousness.

Nevertheless, I put a lot of time and effort to systemize this knowledge and clarify blurred questions, so I have a right to put GPLv3 license on the information gathered and ordered as my intellectual effort result. So, please, respect it.

## My motivation

Why do I create so many files and structure them in such a sophisticated way? My final goal is to build AI solutions that I can maintain as ordinary software, like calculator. This goal - if achievable - can be achieved only with the strong methodology behind it. MLOps, Devsecops, models fine-tuning, context management, and so on and so on. You can easily prototype almost anything with the little help from AI, but the question is whther you can build a reliable, production level system. 

All the problems I call out in this repo I have to learn on my own, so any critique and suggestions are highly welcomed.

My main colleague in this endevour is the Language AI models of any size and any descent, that is why I share my files here, on public for human review, in hope to get feedback on where I am getting wrong in my AI systems understanding. Also, I hope, my articles will be helpful to anybody who thinks the same way as I do.

## About myself

I am 37, I live in Russia, Yekaterinburg. I am only three years in IT - I started with Machine Learning in 2022, then I worked with relational databases (PostgreSQL, Oracle), and now I am a Tech Lead Linux Engineer in the Russian bigtech. I do my AI research (if one can call such activity like this) in my free time after work between family and sleeping hours. 

Salute!
