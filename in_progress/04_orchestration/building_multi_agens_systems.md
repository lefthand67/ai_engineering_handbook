Modern AI systems aren’t giant, single models anymore. They’re **teams of small models and scripts** that cooperate — a bit like humans with different jobs.

This handbook teaches how to design, connect, and control those agents so the system stays reliable, understandable, and future‑proof.

The goal: **predictable, explainable automation** instead of “let’s hope the AI behaves nicely.”

## How to Keep Agents from Talking Gibberish: Schemas

Schemas are your **contracts** between agents — the difference between chaos and calm.

For example:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class ReviewTask(BaseModel):
    task_id: str = Field(..., pattern="^TASK-[0-9]+$")
    summary: str
    confidence: float = Field(..., ge=0, le=1)
```

Every agent must produce output that matches its schema. If not, it fails noisily instead of quietly corrupting data. You can thank yourself later when debugging 3 AM pipeline crashes.

## Keep Logic Modular - Microservice philosophy

Each agent should live in a tidy little container:
- its prompt, 
- model parameters, and 
- parser 

all bundled together.

Frameworks like LangChain make this easy with “Runnables.” Custom builders can do the same through clean Python classes.

The advantage? You can update or swap a single agent without touching the rest.

## Battling Context Limits

Small local models (4B–14B) forget quickly – their “attention span” is short. So, insert a **Summary Agent** between long reasoning steps.

It should compress text into a fixed structure, say:

```
Feature
Constraint
Risk
```

This tiny helper keeps the next agent focused on signal, not noise.

## Local vs Cloud Models: Pick Wisely

**Local LLMs** (vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio)  
- Private, cheap, controllable  
- Require good GPU setup and optimization  

**Cloud Models** (GPT‑4, Claude, Gemini)  
- Easy to scale, less setup  
- Higher cost, vendor‑locked, limited insight  

Many hybrid systems call a local model first and a cloud one only when needed — the best of both worlds.

## Common Pitfalls and How to Dodge Them

| Pitfall | Why It’s Painful | How to Avoid |
|----------|------------------|--------------|
| Agents lose context | You hit token limits | Summarize early and often |
| Version drift | Model/prompt mismatch | Version and log everything |
| Bad parsing | Regex horror stories | Always use schema validation |
| Circular loops | Agents calling each other forever | Keep flows one‑directional |
| Over‑engineering | 15 layers for a simple task | Start simple, then modularize |

## A Healthy Dev Workflow

1. Start with working prototypes.
2. Add structure and validation once logic stabilizes.
3. Test every agent standalone.
4. Connect them step‑by‑step.
5. Add monitoring, logging, and configuration management.
6. Review cost, latency, and output quality regularly.

Think of it like growing a lab experiment into an engine room.

## Practical Example

```python
from langchain.schema.runnable import RunnableSequence

pipeline = RunnableSequence([
    input_parser,
    reasoning_agent,
    summarizer,
    validator,
    storage_handler
])

result = pipeline.invoke(user_input)
print(result)
```

That’s your skeleton — you can plug in almost any logic or model.

## Track the Right Metrics

| Metric | Good Target |
|---------|--------------|
| Schema validation success | ≥ 98 % |
| Average agent response | < 2 s (local) |
| Retry success rate | ≥ 95 % |
| Drift in output format | ≤ 2 % per release |
| Traceability coverage | 100 % |

Numbers make invisible systems visible.

## Keep It Alive

Orchestration systems evolve. Plan quarterly reviews where the team checks:

- Are prompts still clear?
- Are local models underperforming?
- Are logs still meaningful?

Tiny tune‑ups now prevent expensive rebuilds later.

## Key Takeaway

AI orchestration isn’t magic — it’s **software engineering with personality**.
- Write clean interfaces. Expect your models to misbehave.
- Treat prompts as code. Version everything.

If you do all that, you’ll get systems that scale, cooperate, and can be explained to anyone — from auditors to new hires — without fear or mystery.
